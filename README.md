# GetItUploaded
> Minimalistic uploader

## Description

Long story short: I was drawing this layout inside [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) just for fun, so I was planning to delete it one I finish it, but I came across [Supernova Studio](https://supernova.io/) and saw that it is able to perform automatic code generation for Flutter based on Adobe XD or Sketch files.

So, here it is. The generated UI is not responsive (and before edits didn’t really match the layout), that's why I decided to restrict UI orientation programmatically to portrait-only.

After that I've decided to write an MVP. 
**GetItUploaded** is basically a [file.io](https://file.io) client. It uploads a file you select and prompts a "Share" dialog with the link in it.
